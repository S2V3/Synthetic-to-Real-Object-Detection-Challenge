# Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Challenge

This repository contains our solution for the *Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Challenge* on Kaggle, where the goal is to train an object detection model using **only synthetic data** and have it generalize well to real-world images. ([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/synthetic-2-real-object-detection-challenge))

## Challenge Overview

- **Objective:** Train object detection models with *100% synthetic data*; evaluate performance on real images.  
- **Data Provided:**  
  - Synthetic training images + annotations  
  - Synthetic validation (if applicable)  
  - Real-world test images (for evaluation)  
- **Evaluation Metric:** Mean Average Precision (mAP) over the test images (or other detection metrics as defined in the competition rules).  

---

## Approach

- **Model Architecture:**  
  We used a [Faster R‑CNN / YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 / SSD / etc.] backbone pre-trained on [ImageNet / COCO] and fine‑tuned with the synthetic dataset.

- **Data Augmentation:**  
  To help generalization from synthetic → real, we incorporated augmentations such as flips, color jitter, scaling, perspective distortion, randomly adding occlusions, etc.

- **Training Details:**  
  | Parameter        | Value                  |
  |------------------|-------------------------|
  | Learning rate    | e.g. 1e‑4               |
  | Batch size       | e.g. 16                 |
  | Number of epochs | e.g. 50                 |
  | Optimizer        | e.g. Adam / SGD + momentum |
  | Loss functions   | e.g. Focal Loss / IoU / etc. |

- **Ensemble / Post‑processing (if any):**  
  If you combined multiple models or used ensemble techniques / non‑max suppression tweaks, describe here.

## Setup & Dependencies

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python >= 3.x  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow / whichever deep learning framework you used  
- Other required libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- GPU recommended for training (NVIDIA CUDA compatible)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/S2V3/Synthetic-to-Real-Object-Detection-Challenge.git
   cd Synthetic-to-Real-Object-Detection-Challenge
   ```

2. Prepare data:

   - Download synthetic training & validation data from Kaggle.  
   - Organize in directories like:

     ```
     data/
       train/
         images/
         annotations/
       val/
         images/
         annotations/
     ```

3. Train model:

   ```bash
   python train.py --config configs/your_config.yaml
   ```

4. Evaluate / generate predictions:

   ```bash
   python inference.py --checkpoint path_to_model.ckpt --test_dir data/test/images --output predictions.json
   ```

## Results

| Dataset        | mAP @ IoU 0.50 | Comments / Observations |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Real test set  | **X.Y%**         | e.g. “Model tends to miss small occluded objects” |
| Synthetic val  | **A.B%**         | Good baseline but lower variance |

## Further Work

Some ideas to improve performance:

- More varied synthetic scenarios (lighting, backgrounds, occlusion)  
- Domain adaptation techniques (e.g. style transfer, feature alignment)  
- Use pseudo‑labeling on unlabeled real data  
- Fine‑tune on a small set of real data if allowed
